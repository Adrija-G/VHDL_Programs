### VHDL_Programs

VHDL is a hardware description language used for modeling digital systems. 
It allows the design and simulation of logic circuits like multiplexers, counters, flip-flops, etc., and can be synthesized into an actual hardware implementation on FPGAs or ASICs.

## 1. VHDL Basics:
# Entity
The entity describes the external interface of the design, including inputs and outputs.

Example:
``` entity AND_Gate is
Port ( A : in STD_LOGIC;   -- Input A
           B : in STD_LOGIC;   -- Input B
           Y : out STD_LOGIC); -- Output Y
 end AND_Gate;
```

# Architecture

The architecture describes the internal behavior of the entity.

Example:
architecture Behavioral of AND_Gate is
begin
    Y <= A and B; 
end Behavioral;

## 2. VHDL Design Units:

# VHDL designs consist of three parts:

    - Entity: Defines the interface (ports).
    - Architecture: Describes the functionality.
    - Configurations: Optional, used to bind architectures to entities.

  






Example: AND Gate Design
